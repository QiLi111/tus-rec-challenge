# Participation Policy

- Submitted methods must be fully automatic.
- Public and Private Data are permitted, however their use must be disclosed by participants.
- Organizers may participate and be listed in leaderboards, but are not eligble for awards.
- All participants must be from teams (even if the team is composed of a single participant), and each participant can only be a member of a single team.

# Data Usage Policy

The data is made available under [CC BY NC SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/). The challenge data shall be available for use exclusively for research purposes, due to the restrictions from original ethics approval and patient consent. 

The training and validation data will remain publicly available after the completion of the challenge.
<!-- , and is accessible [here](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7870104).  -->
The training and validation data may be used within the research remit of this challenge, and in further research-related publications. The training and validation data is not to be used commercially. However, if the desired use case is unclear, the organizers ask that those accessing the data refrain from further use or distribution outside of this challenge.

# Publication Policy

We are planning to submit a paper including challenge dataset summary and results analysis. Members of the top five participating teams will be invited as co-authors. The participating teams can only publish their novel methodology without discussion of data and obtained results if the above mentioned paper is not published (submission to arXiv is considered as a sufficient waiting period). Once the challenge paper from the organizing team is published, the participants should cite this challenge paper
if their work has not been published.

# Participant Code of Conduct

By participating in this challenge, you as an organizer or participant pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

You pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, code, discussion board entries, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions, when appropriate.

## Scope
